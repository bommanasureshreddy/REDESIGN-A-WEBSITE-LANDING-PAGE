#DESCRIPTION
Website Redesign: LingsCars.com 
BEFORE: 
The original LingsCars.com landing page is well-known for its unique, chaotic 
design filled with: 
 Flashing graphics 
 Clashing colors 
 Pop-up elements 
 Dense information 
 Overlapping fonts 
While it’s memorable and attention-grabbing, this design: 
 Overwhelms users 
 Lacks visual hierarchy 
 Makes navigation difficult 
 Isn’t optimized for mobile 
 Creates visual noise and confusion 
AFTER: 
The redesigned version simplifies everything: 
 Modern, minimalist layout 
 Clean typography 
 Clear sectioning 
 Playful brand identity is preserved with character illustrations 
 CTA buttons like “Lease Now” are clear and visible 
 Cars and prices are well-presented 
 Trustpilot rating is easy to find and read 
 Fully mobile responsive and user-friendly 
DESIGN DECISIONS: 
1. Visual Hierarchy 
→ Clean separation of headings, body text, and CTAs 
2. Typography 
→ Only 1–2 legible fonts used; consistent sizes across layout 
3. Navigation 
→ Sticky top bar with only key links (deals, reviews, contact) 
4. Color Scheme 
→ Neutral background with red/black brand accents for important 
elements 
5. Responsiveness 
→ Mobile-friendly layout with scalable content sections 
6. Imagery 
→ Cars are neatly displayed; Ling’s cartoon is retained in a subtle, fun 
way 
7. Trust Elements 
→ Customer reviews and ratings placed in visible but non-intrusive areas
